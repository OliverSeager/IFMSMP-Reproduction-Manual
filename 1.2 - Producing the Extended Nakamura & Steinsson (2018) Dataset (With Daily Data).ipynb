    "\n",
    "This script creates policy shocks for 159 FOMC meetings by taking the first principal component of FOMC meeting day movements in interest rates. Firstly, movements in implied expectations of the Federal Funds Rate between the meeting of interest and the next, and between the next meeting and the one that follows that. These movements are two series, with each date's movements calculated from two of Federal Funds Futures at 1, 2, 3 or 4 months out, depending on what day of the month a meeting takes place. Secondly, movements in Eurodollar Futures at 6, 12 and 24 months out (ED6, ED12 and ED24).\n",

    "This takes inspiration from Nakamura and Steinsson (2018), who take the first principal component of movements in 30-minute windows surrounding FOMC meetings; they use the same movements in implied expectations of the FFR in addition to ED6, ED9 and ED12 contracts.\n",

    "A Federal Funds Futures contract pays out according to the *average* Federal Funds Rate for the quarter to which it corresponds. Thus, if an FOMC decision occurs on the 16th day of a 31 day month, approximately half the price of the FFF for that month will be made up of the expected or known FFR prior to this date, and approximately half the price will be the expected or known FFR after this date. In theory, if markets expect this meeting to involve no change to the FFR, but the decision is a 0.5% increase, this will be reflected in a 0.25% increase in the rate as reflected by the FFF corresponding to this month. \n",
    "\n",

On any given meeting date, I study surprises to expectations of the FFR between this meeting and the next, and surprises to expectations of the FFR between the next meeting and the one after that. Note that if a meeting occurs in the last week of a month, there is no meeting scheduled for the month that follows.
